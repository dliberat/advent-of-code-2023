## About

In this repository, I solved all of the Advent of Code 2023 puzzles using Rust, as an exercise to get some familiarity with the language.

## Running the code

From inside the project directory, run `cargo build` to build the project.

To run the code for a specific day, provide the number of the day as the first command line argument, followed by the path to a text file containing the input that you wish to use.

**Example: To run Day 3**

```bash
$ cargo run 3 ./inputs/day03.txt
```
